# Retrieve_MSEED_GDRIVE
Script to retrieve and open headers and file content from MSEED files that are stored in a google drive, shared drive, or via shortcut link
This is to prevent interruptions from reading files stored in the cloud.

There are a few steps one needs to follow to get a Google API token and to link the gDrive and subfolders.
